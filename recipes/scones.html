        <p>Here's a wonderful recipe for one of my favourite recipes ever! I eat if every day, even for breakfast to make sure Odi(n) doesn't get it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
	    <li>1 1/4 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
	    <li>1/2  cup packed brown sugar</li>
	    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
	    <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
	    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
	    <li>1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening</li>
	    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
	    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
	    <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
	    <li>Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Cut in shortening and mix until just a few chunks remain. Add buttermilk and vanilla extract; stir until combined.</li>
	    <li>Shape dough into individual scones, about 3 inches across and 1 inch thick. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
	    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before lightly dusting with powdered sugar.</li>
        </ol>
