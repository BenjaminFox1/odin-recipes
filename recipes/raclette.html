        <p>This one's a nice one if you like cheese. Hot, melting, stinking, cheese...</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds raclette cheese, rinds removed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Arrange raclette cheese in six 3- to 4-inch or one 8- to 10-inch cast iron skillet(s), cutting wedges to fit as necessary.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is softened but still slightly firm in center, 5 to 10 minutes. Use a ventilation fan while baking; the cheese is pungent!</li>
            <li>Sprinkle cheese with thyme and pepper to serve.</li>
